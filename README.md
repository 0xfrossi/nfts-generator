# NFT collection's generator

A python script for generate offchain a collection of nfts with their metadatas.

If these directories don't exist will be created:

- *assets* is the folder that must contain all the collection's traits divided in sub folders, one for each category's trait. 
- *layers_data_json* will contain a .json (created by the script) with the paths of all images. 
- *output* will contain all the files generated by the code i.e images of the collection and metadatas.

First fill the 'schemas.json' with the required data. 

The field "layers_order" indicates the order how the layer traits are pasted on themselves. Why is an array? Well, if it's needed you can create multiple pattern.
The field "weights_schema_in_collection" must contains the weights (frequencies) of each pattern.
